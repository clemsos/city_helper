It's very easy to use:

  state_select :user, :state, options, html_options
  city_select  :user, :city, options, html_options
  captital_select :user, :capital_city, options, html_options
  
If you'd like city select auto changed after user changing their choice of state, then you can use:

  state_and_city_select :user, :state, :city, 
                :state => {:include_blank => 'Please select state'}, 
                :city => {:include_blank => 'Please select City'}
                          
You can also use these helpers in FormBuilder:

  form.state_select :state
  form.city_select :city
  form.capital_select :city
  form.state_and_city_select :state, :city
  
You can also use them without object:

  state_select_tag :state
  city_select_tag :city
  capital_select_tag :city
  state_and_city_select_tag :state, :city
